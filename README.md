# Therapy Nomads
This is a personal blog recording the travels and adventures for my wife and I. It was built primarily with React. It was built almost from scratch. I utilized Google Firebase to host it and use as a back end for storage and database.

## Technologies Used
* React
* CSS Modules
* Axios
* Firebase Storage
* Firebase Database
* Redux

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to see your story. 
* As a user, I want to see different blog posts.
* As an admin, I want to add more posts.
* As an admin, I want to add pictures.
* As a user, I want to see all the pictures in one spot. 
* As an admin, I want to add inspirational quotes.
* As a user, I want to post in a forum.

## Problems
I took me a while to learn how to interact with Firebase. I had read the docs and look up other resources. I had some issues with their authentication. The problem I want to tackle is creating a forum. It will be simple with posts and comments. The biggest hurdle will be creating a new node in the databse that will hold those posts and comments data. Also I don't know what I want to do for different people. Maybe have people sign up with a name and password. And they need to sign in to post anything. I will work on this soon.
